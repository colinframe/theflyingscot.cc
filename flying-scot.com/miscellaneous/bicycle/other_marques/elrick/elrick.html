              <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><img src="elrick_35_seat.jpg" width="300" height="253" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />George 
                Elrick was born in Castleford, Yorkshire, in 1908 but moved to 
                Stirling at the age of 27 to open his own bike sales shop. The 
                premises he chose, in the oddly-named Drip Road, had little more 
                than a glorified shed attached to the rear but this was to become 
                George's workshop for the next 40 years. <br />
                <br />
                Although what he did before moving to Stirling isn't too clear, 
                it would appear from the quality of his early Scottish frames 
                that he must have served an apprenticeship with an English builder 
                or gained considerable experience<br />
                building frames before moving north to Scotland. <br />
                <br />
                The chromed bike in the photographs, dating from 1935 and only 
                the fifth he made in Stirling, exhibits a high level of workmanship. 
                He used the best components at that time, such as Chater Lea lugs 
                and bottom bracket and many Chater Lea fittings, then the finest 
                available. <br />
                <br />
                The lugs on the frame on this page were filed to a very fine degree, 
                blending almost seamlessly into the frame tubes. Although not 
                in itself an indicator of quality, it does reveal that George 
                was prepared to take a considerable amount of time over his frames 
                and went the extra mile to produce the finest work he could. <br />
                <br />
                <img src="elrick_35_forks.jpg" width="400" height="534" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />George's 
                widow told me that he built thousands of frames, starting early 
                in the morning and carrying on into the evening. Many of these 
                were sold through cycle shops around the country with which George 
                had contracts. He sometimes received overseas requests for frames, 
                such was their reputation, but Mrs Elrick said all his frames 
                were adorned with his own transfers. <br />
                <br />
                His framebuilding career came to an end around 1975 when his shop 
                was the subject of a compulsory purchase order. Mrs Elrick said 
                the local council had informed George well in advance that his 
                shop would have to go to make way for urban renewal. As a result, 
                he started winding down his operation over the period of more 
                than a year, cancelling his shop contracts in the process.<br />
                <br />
                When it came to paying him compensation, the council, instead 
                of using a normal year's accounts as a reference, based their 
                figure on his last year's accounts when the business was being 
                wound up. Not surprisingly, this meant that George received little 
                compensation and the council saved itself some money. George was 
                left embittered by this sharp practice. <br />
                <br />
                His frames were popular with many racers in Stirlingshire and 
                beyond with some owners paying visits to his family home right 
                up to his death to request Elrick transfers for renovation projects.
