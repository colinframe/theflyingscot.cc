 hspace="10" vspace="0" width="75" align="left">In October 1900, David
Rattray and his sister Agnes opened their first shop in McAslin Street,
Glasgow. In doing so, they laid the foundations of a company that would
go on to produce Scotland's premier lightweight bicycle, "The Scot", or
perhaps better known as "The Flying Scot". </p>
          <p>Over a period of eighty-three years, their cycle shop would
            grow to become a focal point and meeting place for many cycle
            enthusiasts from Scotland and afar, the Scot name representing what was
            thought to be the best in hand built lightweight racing and touring
            machines. Their reputation became so widespread that at one time most
            cyclists in Scotland, owned raced or actively sought one.</p>
          <p><img src="../rattray/premises/images/sml_murray1920.jpg"
 alt="Shopfront 1920s" height="160" hspace="10" width="175"
 align="right">From the small shop in McAslin Street, David Rattray
            progressed from cycle hire, to sales and servicing, and in 1913 moved
            to larger premises in adjacent Murray Street. In common with most shops
            of the time, they became agents for a number of established lightweight
            brands, for example Saxon, Grubb and Selbach and in later years for the
            larger manufacturers like Sunbeam, Dawes and Raleigh.</p>
          <p>David Rattray was closely involved with the thriving road
            racing scene in particular in the West of Scotland, and had contact
            with many successful or aspiring "speedmen". When it came to sourcing
            bicycles for competition however, the absence of any substantial
            indigenous lightweight cycle industry in Scotland meant a limited
            choice of marques, from those produced across the border with virtually
            no input from the Scottish riders using these machines.</p>
          <p>By
            the mid 1920s a few Scottish builders began to produce frames, designed
            to meet local riders specifications and requirements. Though a few were
            quite successful, these were generally one or two-man shops with
            limited production.</p>
          <p>In 1928 David Rattray with Jack Smith, by then his partner in
            the company, began to manufacture their own lightweight frames, mainly
            built to order for members of the local cycling clubs. In 1935,
            production began in earnest and they started selling the machines as
  "The Scot". The first of approximately 15,000 complete bicycles and
            frames that were to be handbuilt by the company until it's closure in
            1983.</p>
          <p>Through the mid to late 1930s Scot frames steadily became the
            machine of choice for local clubmen. By the end of the decade they had
            carved themselves a niche in the lightweight market.</p>
          <p><img src="../rattray/publicity/images/ratadd1.jpg"
 alt="advert 1930s" height="384" hspace="10" width="238" align="left">War in Europe intervened however, and the commencement of
            hostilities in 1939, saw many cycle shops forced to close down and
            manufacturers throughout the country, obliged to support the war effort
            by transferring production to essential war work. <img
 src="../rattray/publicity/images/adv_59_sass.jpg" alt="Sassenach's"
 height="83" hspace="10" width="200" align="right">The high quality
            steel and steel tubing, necessary for the construction of lightweight
            frames, steadily became all but unobtainable. Reynolds, the main tubing
            supplier, became almost entirely focused on producing aircraft parts
            including for use in the construction of Supermarine Spitfires. The
            other British tubing manufacturer, Accles &amp; Pollock. (A&amp;P) were
            similarly affected.<br>
            <br>
            Rattrays were not immune to the problems that the shortages created,
            and eventually had to give up construction, though there is evidence
            that they were still producing frames as late as 1941. The company did
            not close down however, as they were extremely fortunate in gaining
            essential war contracts for the production of pins used in the
            manufacture of Bailey bridges.</p>
          <p>Some of their own staff were retrained, and additional staff
            taken on at Murray Street, were trained up as machinists/turners, new
            machinery being bought to cope with a rather different sort of work
            than the company had hitherto been used.<br>
            <br>
            Whilst the war in Europe ended in 1945, wartime austerity
            and conditions continued in Britain for a further six years. As part of
            the drive to rebuild Europe, and to pay for national debt manufacturers
            were obliged to produce goods for export before those for home use. Out
            of both necessity to travel to work however and a rapid increase in the
            amount weekend cyclists, Rattrays found their products in great demand,
            however they were severely affected by materials shortages, and even by
            late 1947, delivery times on custom built machines had risen to between
            eight and twelve weeks. Perhaps taking advantage of this, in the same
            year the premises at Murray Street were rebuilt and enlarged to cope
          with the ever increasing amount of orders.</p>
<p>The purchase and opening around this time of a shop at 254
            High Street (formerly Malcolm Smith's) gave another outlet on one of
            Glasgow's busiest streets. This was not the first time Rattrays had a
  "branch" shop, having previously had another shop at 212 Parliamentary
            Road, though they never achieved the popularity and success of Murray
            Street and latterly Alexandra Parade, being substantially smaller. The
            main shop could not have been better placed, being just around the
            corner from the clubrooms of the Cyclists' Touring Club (C.T.C.)
            Glasgow District Association at 379 Parliamentary Road.<br>
            <br>

 alt="advert 1937" height="392" hspace="10" width="250" align="left"
 border="0">In the early 1950s Reg Harris, then World Professional Sprint Champion,
            had a Scot made for his wife by Rattrays framebuilder John Hamilton.
            Although it would have been the perfect advertising coup, Rattrays were
            not able to use any of the publicity from this as Reg was at that time
            contracted to ride for Raleigh.<br>
            <br>
            Such was the popularity of the Scots and the products of
            the homegrown cycle-makers, that Rattrays as with many Scottish frame
            builders, saw little need to advertise their products nationally.
            Similarly they did not attend the national cycle shows held outwith
          Scotland.</p>
<p>With modernised premises, production at it's peak, employing
            at least five framebuilders plus assistants to cope with the work on an
            expanding order book the company must have been in good shape. Sadly
            however David Rattray passed away in 1950 at the age of 72, leaving the
            company to be run by his friend and partner Jack Smith, with his wife
            Lottie as his business partner. David Rattray's sister Agnes, was to
            pass away exactly one year on to the day that her brother had died.</p>
          <p>The company was always led from the front by Jack Smith, who
            with his salesmen appear to have known exactly what the customers
            wanted. <img src="../rattray/premises/images/sml_murray1965.jpg"
 alt="shpfront 60s" height="146" hspace="10" width="175" align="right"
 border="0">He developed the business to the point where in Scotland
            purchasing a "serious" bicycle meant only a Scot would do, and the
            choice was really just what colour and finish, and what you could
            afford. Business wasn't only restricted to the home market, a steady
            stream of native and ex-pat customers ordered Scot's to take home, in
            particular to Canada, the USA and Australia. Rattray's also became a
            fully fledged wholesaler selling the Scot frames to other Cycle shops
            around Scotland and the North of England.</p>
          <p>In the early 1950s areas all over Glasgow and particularly
            the city centre were selected and planned for what was euphemistically
            called "redevelopment".</p>
          <p>The Townhead district was one of the last areas to be started
            and unfortunately Murray Street was located right in the middle, In
            1968 the company was served with a compulsory purchase order on the
            premises.</p>
          <p><img src="../rattray/publicity/images/ratadd3.jpg"
 alt="advert 51" height="259" hspace="10" width="200" align="left"
 border="0">The need to move from Murray Street was unavoidable, and came
            on the back of a lean period, when the car had become the means for
            folk to get away at the weekend. The effect on the company and its
            finances was devastating. For a short period the company traded from an
            old factory and shop at 86/88 Dalhousie St, in Glasgow, itself later
            the subject of a compulsory purchase order. The company leased smaller
            and less suitable premises at 261 Alexandra Parade, at which they
            remained until closure.</p>
          <p>Fortunately for Rattrays the loyal customers they had built up
            over the years and the quality of their products ensured that they
            would be followed wherever they ended up in Glasgow.</p>
          <p>Sadly though the company was dealt a further blow when on 15
            February 1973, Jack Smith died aged 69.</p>
          <p>It was a sad loss for the family and to the trade but also to
            the community. Over 300 people attended the funeral at Glasgow
            Crematorium (Maryhill) on the 20th of February, including
            representatives from the cycling clubs and from the trade, notably
            Brown Brothers, Dunlop, The North British Machine Co., Raleigh,
            Reynolds Tubes, Honda, Glasgow Corporation, Glasgow City Police,
            Glasgow Rangers Football Club, the Daily Record newspaper and Cadder
            Freemasons.</p>
          <p>Clearly it was going to be a hard act to follow, and from
            Jack's death the company was run by his son John, with his mother
            remaining as partner. They did not, however appear to recover from the
            loss of Jack and the company fortunes began to decline. This was not
            helped by a general downturn in the sports cycle market, and in
            particular the demand for lightweight specials. This also despite
            Steyr-Daimler-Puch (GB) Ltd. taking a 49% share in the company as part
            of their efforts to gain a foothold in the British cycling market. Even
            the diversification into selling Honda motorcycles some years
            previously hadn't halted the decline in the company fortunes.</p>
          <p>The final years at Alexandra Parade and the company's eventual
            demise have become somewhat shrouded in the mists of time. However,
            what is known of the last days tells a sad story about the end of what
            had once been Scotland's premier bike manufacturer.</p>
          <p>As far back as the late 1970's, Rattrays was finding it
            increasingly difficult to make ends meet. Against that background, even
            a well-run business would have struggled and, whatever the strengths of
            Rattrays, efficiency and good business practice were not words that
            could have been readily applied to the Glasgow firm as it faltered.
            Puch agreed to take over the company debts in exchange for the majority
            Rattrays shareholding of John Smith, ending the family involvement that
            had started more than sixty years earlier.</p>
          <p>In 1981, at a cycle trade show in Harrogate, Evan Ritchie was
            approached by a senior figure at Puch (GB) Ltd, Peter Bolton, who said
            that they were keen to off-load Rattrays. Mr. Ritchie agreed to take
            over the business and the lease of the Alexandra Parade premises. "It
            was a very large premises, a 2000 sq. ft. shop, big workshops, machine
            shops, huge stores etc., It used to be an RAF fighter command
            headquarters and command centre for Scotland during WW2 in the RAF's
            fight against the Luftwaffe and was built like an air raid shelter,
            which to a certain extent it was," said Mr. Ritchie. "Apart from retail
            stock there were included quite a few boxes of Reynolds 531 tubing,
            forks, dropouts, handlebars, wheels, tyres etc., plus the basic
            machinery for making frames. The place was very poorly managed with
            rubbish lying about. Some of the anxious staff, envisaging no future in
            Rattrays, lacked discipline and felt neither pride nor motivation to do
            their best work. Puch were paying their wages from Nottingham and the
            supervision from there was claimed by some to be negligible. They
            (Puch) wanted to get rid of their big Glasgow headache. I therefore
            stated my own terms."</p>
          <p>Mr. Ritchie's company, Barbour's Garages Ltd, inherited the
            Flying Scot and The Scot names and the company was, according to Mr.
            Ritchie, "Perking up, front shop and workshops cleaned and refurbished,
            redecorated, extended, orders coming in, sales going up, the staff
            happy and remotivated and all involved seeing the light at the end of
            the tunnel." The company was again "beginning to make money" when he
            ran it. During his ownership, the frame numbering sequence was changed
            to incorporate his initials (and the Queens!). "I still have ER2 here
            in Fraserburgh which is a beautiful machine in perfect working order
            and a pride and joy of mine," he said. "I was involved personally in
            the making of it and others, helping with sandblasting, spray painting,
            assembling, putting on the stickers etc." However, Mr. Ritchie and the
            accountant (Mr. A. J. Birnie CA) for Barbour's Garages, who was also a
            significant shareholder in Barbour's, were involved in a business
            dispute and Rattrays was eventually sold to the accountant for a 1p
            cheque as part his settlement for his shares in the garage firm.</p>
          <p>Rattray's fortunes didn't improve, and on the 5th of April 1983 Steyr-Daimler-Puch started the process of compulsory liquidation and consequently  the staff were made redundant and
            Rattray's lease, the assets, including the machinery and tubing, were
            all sold off, with the Scot and Flying Scot names being sold to Jim
            Houston, owner of Glasgow bike retailer, Dale's Cycles. Jim created a division of his own company to handle the process (Flying Scot Cycles Ltd) and during the last weeknds of 1983 held a public sale of what remained.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. Ritchie
            added, "It was it was a heartbreaking demise to the most famous
            Scottish cycle manufacturing company. Had it continued for a few short
            years till the BMX &amp; Mountain Bike boom arrived, Rattrays could
            have been a company and the Scot a bike to be reckoned with."</p>
          <p>In 1983, Rattray's closed Alexandra Parade for good without a ripple of remorse
            from anyone. Finally In late 1985 the company David Rattray (Cycles) Ltd. was officially in liqidation.</p>
          <p>Over the years, thousands of frames and complete bicycles were
            produced at Murray Street, and latterly at Alexandra Parade, Glasgow.
            All were built to the same high standard from club machine to tourer to
            top-flight racer. Each frame hand built with the same care and
            attention the like of which modern technology cannot replicate.</p>
          <p>Today, more than 22 years later, nothing remains of either
            Murray Street, or the once busy and thriving Parliamentary Road, the
            streets and the original premises having all but disappeared, flattened
            and replaced with modern low &amp; hi-rise housing. Similarly all that
            remains of the Alexandra Parade premises is the land on which they
            stood, and the ubiquitous small "factory units".</p>
          <p>It's not the end of the story though. Perhaps initially
            trading on the "Scot" name and reputation to some extent, Jim Houston
            restarted limited production using the frame builder, Dave Yates, at
            M.Steel Cycles. These however are entirely 'custom' built and are
            produced to order and at present only "on request" howvever Jim's company  &quot;Flying Scot Cycles Ltd.&quot; was dissolved on the 12th of July 1991.</p>
          <p>Despite their widespread popularity Flying Scots are
            disappearing fast from the cycling scene, though many still exist.
            Three remain on show to the public in Glasgow, at the Museum of
            Transport at Kelvingrove. Of these, the 1950 mixte framed cycle belongs
        to Lottie Smith, Jack's wife, and is on permanent loan to the museum.</p></td>
