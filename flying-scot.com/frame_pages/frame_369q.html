        <b><i><font color="#FF0000">Bicycle, photographs &amp; story by Bruce 
        Robbins</font></i></b></font> 
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">I 
          have to confess right at the start that I was looking for a Hobbs of 
          Barbican frame when I stumbled across my Flying Scot track bike.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../frame_images/q1/369q/369q_rearhub.jpg" alt="369Q Rear Hub" width="255" height="244" border="1" align="right" />Having 
          been convinced of the merits of fixed gear bikes by that persuasive 
          old fox Sheldon Brown, I had already got my hands on a 1950s Claud Butler 
          frame that lent itself quite neatly to a single speed conversion. However, 
          my father used a fixed gear Hobbs bike more than 50 years ago when he 
          was in his early twenties and, out of pure nostalgia, I fancied putting 
          together a similar machine. (Incidentally, before I learned to appreciate 
          fixed gear cycling, I asked my dad why he made do all those years with 
          just one gear. "<i>Only lassies need more than one gear</i>," was his 
          answer. But didn't you have to get off your bike on steep hills? "<i>Only 
          lassies get off their bikes on hills</i>". Apologies to all the lassies 
          out there who could probably grind me into the ground.)<br />
          <br />
          Hobbs bikes were never that common in their hey-day and are even rarer 
          now. My inquiries eventually led me to the home of a club racer who 
          apparently had an unknown bike of approximately the right age hanging 
          in his garage. Could it be an elusive Hobbs? Unfortunately, the chap, 
          Frank Coupar, had died some months previously and the bike turned out 
          to be a Scot.<br />
          <br />
          This bike, as is the case with many old cycles, came with a considerable 
          background and it's a history that imparts a heavy burden on the new 
          owner.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../frame_images/q1/369q/369q_chatercrnk.jpg" alt="369Q Cranks" width="254" height="250" border="1" align="right" />Frank, 
          who lived in Dundee on Scotland's east coast, just a forty minute drive 
          from Bob's Stonehaven shop, had owned it from new, covering many thousands 
          of miles on it.<br />
          <br />
          As was the custom before car ownership became widespread, he would use 
          his bike to take him to the race or track meet, strip it of mudguards, 
          brakes and anything else deemed unnecessary on the day, compete and 
          then put it all back together again for the ride home. Despite being 
          a genuine track bike, it therefore had drillings for front and rear 
          brakes and clearance for mudguards.<br />
          <br />
          It was, according to his wife, his pride and joy and he would think 
          little of "<i>just popping out for a hundred miler</i>". Although the 
          bike is now mine, I can't help but feeling that it will somehow remain 
          Frank's. Certainly, that's the way I'll always think of it.<br />
          <br />
          Over the years, the Scot, it must be said, had suffered quite badly. 
          Fifteen years of dust had settled on the upper surface of every frame 
          tube and component, providing a nice, retentive "sponge" for any moisture 
          that might be about - and we get plenty of that in Scotland.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../frame_images/q1/369q/369q_htlugs.jpg" alt="369Q Head Tube" width="191" height="354" border="1" align="right" />As 
          a result, much of the paintwork was eaten away and everything else was 
          either rusted or corroded. My delight at discovering a 51-year-old bike 
          that seemed completely original was quickly tempered by the realisation 
          that many of the components were beyond economical repair.<br />
          <br />
          The front Conloy Asp wheel rim was holed from half a century's use; 
          the Lyotard rat trap pedals were badly rusted; the severely corroded 
          side pull brakes were different models; the Chater Lea cranks had rusted 
          through in places and been given a quick spray with some silver paint, 
          presumably to keep up appearances at club meetings, and the Brooks Sprinter 
          saddle, with the usual scuff marks around the edges, had also started 
          to curve inwards at the sides as it dried out, rendering its normally 
          slim profile even more emaciated. The GB brake levers were not a matched 
          pair, either.<br />
          <br />
          I began to build up a picture of a bike that had been used with just 
          a front brake for many years, hence the wear on the front rim, and had 
          then had a rear brake added, probably for touring as the racing years 
          passed.<br />
          <br />
          It was obvious, then, that unless I could source identical replacement 
          parts, some of the bike's originality would have to be lost. While it 
          would have been possible, eventually, to accumulate the proper bits, 
          it was at this stage that I decided to stick closely to the spirit of 
          the bike rather than slavishly trying to restore it to its works specification. 
          With a 1960 Cinelli Super Corsa in my shed awaiting a complete restoration, 
          too, there was already no shortage of things to do to pass away the 
          long winter nights.<br />
          <br />
          Those parts that were serviceable were the rear wheel with high flange 
          British Hub hub, Strata seatpost, and the track bars and Ambrosio stem.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../frame_images/q1/369q/369q_htbadge.jpg" alt="369Q Head Badge" width="256" height="361" border="1" align="right" />When 
          it came to the frame, drastic action was needed. It looked as if it 
          would need a re-spray and so nothing would be lost in trying to give 
          it a bit of lustre. Bob described how he had brought a GB stem back 
          to life by rubbing it with very fine sandpaper and metal polish so I 
          thought I would give it a go.<br />
          <br />
          Using 1500 grit paper and metal polish, I scrubbed away at the paint 
          surfaces and managed to smooth most of the rough, pitted marks. After 
          a good bit more rubbing, the surface began to take on a shine and further 
          polishing with car wax had it, if not quite gleaming, then at least 
          a bit shinier and protected from the elements.<br />
          <br />
          Black marks that had eaten through most of the paint layers still remain 
          and the frame is very obviously old and well-used but it's a patina 
          that fits the bike's age very well indeed. The down tube and seat tube 
          decals are still there and reasonably complete although the enameling 
          in the head badge has faded quite badly.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../frame_images/q1/369q/369q_stem.jpg" alt="369Q Stem" width="256" height="256" border="1" align="right" />I 
          started to rebuild the bike using the Chater Lea cranks, stripped of 
          their silver paint, and a pair of SR (not Super Record!) pedals but 
          I wasn't entirely happy with this combination! The Cinelli had brought 
          with it BSA cottered cranks and inch-pitch chainring and a pair of Campagnolo 
          Record track pedals so these were cleaned up and pressed into service. 
          The chrome-plated cranks came up like knew after being rubbed with scrunched 
          up aluminium cooking foil and metal polish by my ten and eight-year-old 
          boys, Cameron and Finlay. I never cease to be amazed at what lurks beneath 
          the layers of muck often to be found on old bikes (or wee boys for that 
          matter). The Chater Leas might be put back on after they have been rechromed 
          - a process that will cost about &#163;15-&#163;20.<br />
          <br />
          A Brooks Pro saddle and Modolo brakes/levers that also came in a sack 
          of parts with the Cinelli were transferred over, too. I had intended 
          to use these brakes on the Italian bike but their drop was too great 
          and a bit strange that they wouldn't fit a 1960 road bike but were okay 
          on a 1950 track machine. Had the Scot come with matching brakes, I would 
          have used them but the front was a Coureur Plus while the rear was only 
          identified as a "Hiduminium model". The Ambrosio stem polished up reasonably 
          well with the same tin foil/metal polish approach but the track bars, 
          too deep and narrow for comfort on a road bike, were ditched.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../frame_images/q1/369q/369q_fronthub.jpg" alt="369Q Front Hub" width="254" height="133" border="1" align="right" />A 
          pal, who has a vast collection of vintage bikes, built up a pair of 
          wheels using my high flange Campagnolo hubs and Fiamme sprint rims taking 
          the rear wheel from the Scot as payment. He was also able to supply 
          an inch-pitch chain and rear sprocket. The 46-tooth chainring and 10-tooth 
          sprocket give it a 62-inch gear.<br />
          <br />
          I quite like brightly-coloured bikes but the Scot is a fairly uninspiring 
          metallic blue so I plumped for blue cork handlebar tape to tone in with 
          the blue Bluemels mudguards and black Brooks saddle.<br />
          <br />
          After much soul - not to mention wallet - searching, I decided to stick 
          with the original paintwork, certainly for the time being. It's shiny-scruffy 
          but, right now, I prefer that to a new enamel finish. If I do eventually 
          have it painted, it will probably be to kill off any rust that re-emerges.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../frame_images/q1/369q/369q_stlug.jpg" alt="369Q Seat Lug" width="254" height="248" border="1" align="right" />As 
          it is, the bike is a dream on the road. The steeper angles, possibly 
          helped by the inch-pitch set-up, mean that it is much more responsive 
          than my Claud Butler. The gearing is probably a little low for flattish 
          terrain but fine for the hills around my country home. The Scot is the 
          first bike I've had with tubulars and, in all honesty, I can't say I've 
          noticed a great difference. Still, it's a track bike so I'll stick with 
          them and hope I don't get any punctures!<br />
          <br />
          It's now the turn of the Cinelli to get some attention but another Flying 
          Scot is looming on the horizon. It's a 1950s road bike, again used for 
          many years by a club racer, and would make a lovely companion for the 
          tracker if the owner can be persuaded to part with it. Italy's finest 
          may have to take a back seat yet again...<br />
