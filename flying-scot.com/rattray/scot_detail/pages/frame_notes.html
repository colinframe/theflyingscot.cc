              where the provenance of a frame is well documented or can be linked 
              by the original owner to a specific event, it can contradict the 
              year that the frame number appears to indicate. Much of this has 
              to do with the way that the cycle trade operates and specifically 
              David Rattray &amp; Co. and the business they built up over a number 
              of years.<br />
              <br />
              In the absence of any supporting documentation or knowledge of the 
              original sale, it is reasonable to assume that the age of the frame 
              or bicycle is that indicated by the frame number.<br />
              <br />
              This is not as straightforward as it seems, and there is a need 
              to qualify this statement and to perhaps explain the reason that 
              apparent discrepancies can and do exist ;<br />
              <br />
              Rattray's business included the construction of lightweight frames 
              by their own framebuilders. These were built throughout the year 
              to be sold on there own or built up into complete bicycles. direct 
              by Rattray's, by other Cycle Shops acting as agents, and by mail 
              order.<br />
              <br />
              A large number of frames were built in advance in both a finished 
              and unfinished state. Finished frames (i.e. complete and painted 
              etc.) in the more popular colours and sizes, were effectively 'ready 
              to retail' complete and stamped with a frame number appropriate 
              to the year to be sold. Those finished frames not used directly 
              for display, and the unfinished or 'bare' frames would be held, 
              in stock awaiting completion or use, to fulfil orders and replenish 
              display stock.<br />
              <br />
              Where it was not possible to meet the requirements of the customer 
              from the finished stock, the unfinished stock would be used in the 
              first instance. If however there was no suitable frame from stock 
              or as a result of some other unusual request by the customer (Rattray's 
              options list was wide and varied), a frame would have to be built 
              from scratch.<br />
              <br />
              All frames were stamped with the frame number prior to painting 
              with the next sequential frame number, and a code appropriate to 
              that year. If frames were to go into immediate use, either for display 
              or for sale they would have been stamped a short time after construction. 
              If however the frames were to be held as unfinished stock, no number 
              would have been applied, effectively preventing them from becoming 
              'dated'. Unfinished frames could therefore receive a frame number 
              some time after construction.<br />
              <br />
              How long display or 'finished' stock would remain unsold depended 
              on demand for that particular size or colour. More often than not, 
              a number of finished frames and complete bicycles were carried over 
              from one year to the next. It is therefore possible to have a frame 
              with one particular years 'frame number' sold within days, within 
              the same year, or at the extreme anything up to say three years 
              from when it was first stamped with the frame number.<br />
              <br />
              Construction of the following years frames would begin typically 
              at the end of the season, when the trade is at it's quietest, i.e. 
              from about mid to late September onwards. The assumption is that 
              the finished frames would be stamped with a number appropriate to 
              the following year. These frames would however be built in parallel 
              with any needed to be meet customer demand during the remainder 
              of the year i.e. from September to December. It is assumed that 
              frames built in this case would normally receive a current year 
              number, though clearly if an order could be met from those built 
              and already stamped from the following years stock, they would have 
              been used. This could give rise to the unusual situation where a 
              frame appears to be dated and sold prior to the year indicated by 
              the frame number.<br />
              <br />
              Whilst the present frame number table is logical and constructed 
              from first owners memories and some original documentation, each 
              frame number has to be taken in it's own context. It is difficult 
              to argue with an owner from new, who insists a frame was bought 
              in 1953, when the table indicates it was 1951...... Both the owner 
              and the table are probably correct - i.e. It was stamped, painted 
              and available for sale in late 51' but not sold till 53'. at the 
              extremes frame 62B could have been sold two years after 63B.<br />
