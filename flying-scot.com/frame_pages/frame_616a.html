              a teen-ager in High School, my family moved out of the school district. 
              With the principal's permission, I continued to attend Humberside 
              Collegiate Institute in Toronto, even though it was over ten kilometers 
              from my new home. Buses were expensive and inconvenient, so I rode 
              my old CCM bike most days. School was in a ritzy neighborhood; some 
              of my classmates even drove new cars. Beginning to feel ashamed 
              of my rusty transportation, I saved my money until I could afford 
              a Raleigh racer with a Sturmey-Archer three speed.<br />

            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About this 
              time I joined the Canadian Youth Hostels and started weekend long 
              bicycle rides to nearby hostels., The Raleigh began to look shabby 
              alongside my companions more sophisticated machines.</font></p>

              riding with Olympic hopefuls in the local cycling club, I realized 
              I would have to move up to their class with an even better bike. 
              For months, I inspected carefully every bike I could - studied their 
              geometry and features, asked questions, poured over cycling magazines 
              and wrote away for literature. Then one day, at a Race meeting in 
              Hamilton, a sleek black machine spoke to me. It sang. It was the 
              most beautiful thing I had ever seen It's owner informed me rather 
              haughtily, that he had it custom made by David Rattray of Glasgow.</font></p></td>

              was a "Flying Scot", named after a famous high-speed steam train 
              in Scotland. I fired off a letter to Rattray's that night. They 
              responded with an and a very nice letter informing me that it would 
              cost between 200 and 300 Canadian dollars, depending on what equipment 
              I wanted on it. Since I was working full time by then and only earning 
              $1,500 a year, this was the equivalent of spending $3,000 to $5,000 
              for a bicycle today. At the time, I could have bought a car for 
              that price, but that thought never entered my head.<br />

            <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Never mind 
              ! I must have one ! My specification took up two pages. The size 
              and length of each tube, angle, and fitting were carefully considered. 
              The frame would be triple chrome-plated, double-butted Reynolds 
              531 tubing overlaid with robins-egg blue transparent enamel, the 
              paper-thin lugs outlined in gold, with Simplex gears from France, 
              head fittings from Italy, Bayliss-Wiley wide flanged Continental

              spokes, Dunlop silver sprite tires, removable pannier carrier, "state-of-the-art" 
              everything. There would be a slight reduction in price because I 
              already had a genuine Brooks leather saddle that finally fit my

              got a ride from Edinburgh to Glasgow in a Rolls-Royce and made our 
              way to Rattray's factory. The company director took us on a tour 
              of the old brick building and bought us tea and cakes in the shop 
              next door. I got to meet and shake hands with the craftsman who 
              was building my wheels. He was stringing them with the care of a 
              violin maker and told me that he would carefully hand file them 
              until they were perfectly balanced and tuned liked a harp. The director 
              explained that the frame was finished, but I couldn't see it because 
              it had been sent out for chroming. He did introduce me to the old 
              gentleman who had hand-made the curlicued lugwork and brazed the 
              frame together.<br />

              refrigerator was waiting for me in customs. The officer couldn't 
              believe any idiot would pay that kind of money for a bicycle that 
              didn't have a motor on it. He just had to see it, and he shook his

              New York and Michigan states. It even took me over the Rocky Mountains, 
              not once but twice. Thrown on and off trains and trucks, it never 
              broke a spoke or bent anything. We never won any important races,
