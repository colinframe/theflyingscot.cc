              <img src="obree_orig.jpg" width="250" height="305" border="1" align="left" />Cycling 
              struggles to get a mention in the mainstream British media, as it's 
              neither cricket or football and even throughout the weeks of 'Le 
              Tour' you have to search through most newspapers for a report of 
              the previous days stage, if in fact they've bothered at all.<br />
              <br />
              In 1993, albeit for a brief period only and perhaps for all the 
              wrong reasons, that was all to change courtesy of one man, Graeme 
              Obree, when he smashed the world hour record of Francesco Moser 
              comprehensively.<br />
              <br />
              At that time not many cyclists or enthusiasts outwith the Scottish 
              club scene would have known who Graeme was, so it was somewhat surprising 
              when not only did he beat the hour record, but he achieved it on 
              a machine that he built himself, and included bearings he'd salvaged 
              from an old washing machine, a point the media didn't fail to capitalise 
              on.<br />
              <br />
              What the press seemed to miss was Graeme's pure athletic ability 
              and his determination to beat a world record previously only attempted 
              by the top European Professionals, at the pinnacle of their careers 
              and using state of the art technology. The only wind tunnel testing 
              up until then was a ride on a local '10' with a stiff headwind !<br />
              <br />
              Obree's first attempt at the hour took place at the Olympic track 
              in Hamar, Norway. The previous day he had been unable to get near 
              the record distance however on the Saturday, the day on which he 
              was due to leave, he was so convinced that he could achieve it, 
              he persuaded the officials to let him try again. He broke Mosers 
              record by 445 metres. covering 51.596 Km.<br />
              <br />
              Despite popular myth, his bicycle (which he later coined "old faithful") 
              wasn't built from an old washing machine however, he did hand build 
              it, and incorporated a piece of metal tube he found apparently when 
              out on a training ride, parts from a BMX, and a bearing - taken 
              from a washing machine !.<br />
              <br />
              What was particularly unusual at the time, was his aerodynamic position 
              on the bike. The arrangement of the handlebars, allowed him to get 
              stretched out but adopt a position with arms tucked in out of the 
              way. Played down initially by other riders looking to attempt the 
              record, it was quickly adopted in various disguises by them all 
              - including the great Francesco Moser once the potential was realised. 
              At the World Track Championships in the same year he went on to 
              take the 4000 metres pursuit championship again in a record time, 
              firmly establishing a rank amateur up there with the best and the 
              fastest.<img src="obree_pos.jpg" width="273" height="175" border="1" align="right" /></font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">His 
              hour record had only stood for six days as Chris Boardman exceeded 
              the distance by a further 674 metres (at 52.270 Km). Not content 
              to let go, Obree came back the following year in April 1994 and 
              at Bordeaux beat the record again, at 52.713 Km. The following month, 
              the UCI changed the rules in an attempt to outlaw the position. 
              When he turned up at the World Championships and got through the 
              initial rounds, the officials decided to "interpret" the rules and 
              disqualified him.<br />
              <br />
              Not be beaten yet, in 1995 he turned up with a more conventional 
              framed machine, and a modified position that put his arms out "superman" 
              style he won the 4000 metres World Track Championships in record 
              time. It was to no avail and in 1996 with everyone and his neighbour 
              using the "superman" position to great effect, the UCI again re-wrote 
              the rules regulating the forward extension of the handlebars and 
              beginning the the draconian rules to prevent "technical advantage" 
              (read progress).<br />
              <br />
              Graemes domestic achievements, include winning the RTTC title for 
              50 Miles in 1 hour 39 minutes 1 second and the 10 at 18 minutes 
              27 seconds, which stood from 1993 to 1996. he also won the RTTC 
              25 Miles in 48 minutes 55 seconds. On the track he won the British 
              4,000 metres Pursuit from 1993 to 1996 and in Scotland on the road 
              was the National 10 mile time trial champion between 1988 &amp; 
              1992<br />

              One predecessor of 'old faithful' was this machine he built and 
              seen here at a road race in Carluke in 1987. The short back end 
              prevented Graeme from using double chain-rings and the frame has 
              a brazed-on chain guide.</font></p>
