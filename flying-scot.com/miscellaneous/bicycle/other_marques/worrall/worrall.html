        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">At 
          the start of the 1930s, a young Hamilton signwriter was beginning, like 
          millions of others around the world, to feel the full effects of the 
          Depression.<br />
          <br />
          In fact, at times it seemed to Ernie Worrall that the only sector of 
          the economy that wasn't in recession was cycling, as the ever-increasing 
          numbers of new bike enthusiasts seemed determined to prove. Cycling 
          was entering a "boom" phase, relative to the rest of the economy, and 
          the bicycle industry seemed a good bet for the future.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">Ernie 
          and brother Stanley set up "shop" initially in a wash-house, honing 
          their framebuilding skills while continuing with their original jobs. 
          Ernie would work during the day as a signwriter and build frames in 
          the evening while his brother, an engineer, operated the same system 
          in reverse. They started by making bikes for themselves and took it 
          from there.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="worrall1.jpg" alt="Worrall Advert" width="292" height="103" border="1" align="left" />Bikes 
          bearing the E &amp; S Worrall transfer started to become an ever more 
          common site in the Glasgow area. Scotland could boast some fine lightweight 
          framebuilders in the 1930s but Worrall products stood comparison with 
          the best.<br />
          <br />
          The success they enjoyed enabled them to open a shop in Duke Street 
          in Hamilton with a workshop nearby in Bailey's Causeway. They later 
          moved to other premises a short hop away in Duke Street.<br />
          <br />
          They made two frames-the Rigidity and the Continental. The Rigidity 
          used "squatter" lugs with short points and thin, pencil-type stays. 
          The Continental, borrowing some styling tips from European framebuilders, 
          had lugs with longer, tapering points and thicker stays. Each benefited 
          from Ernie's skill with a brush, exhibiting some fine box-lining and 
          lug-lining work.<br />
          <br />
          In 1934, as their expertise grew, the brothers developed a sealed bottom 
          bracket which they went on to patent. <a href="worrall_patent.html"><img src="447294.gif" alt="Cutaway Bracket" width="200" height="138" border="0" align="right" /></a>Concerned 
          about the water and detritus that would find its way into the bottom 
          bracket via the open-ended seat tube, they had started brazing a metal 
          cylinder into the bottom bracket shell which completely isolated the 
          bearings from grime, a major cause of wear.<br />
          </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><b><i>&lt;&lt;Click 
          on the bracket shell to see the patent in full&gt;&gt;</i></b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">Although 
          an obvious-enough solution to the problem, no one had thought to patent 
          it and the Worralls' application was duly granted. However, the cost 
          of maintaining the patent proved prohibitive so it was only in force 
          for a year.<br />
          <br />
          Ernie and Stanley continued to build their frames with the patented 
          device which had the added bonus of stiffening the bottom bracket assembly 
          at a time when frame "whip" - the propensity of the tubing to flex under 
          heavy pedalling - was becoming an issue.<br />
          <br />
          The outbreak of WWII in 1939 and the subsequent years devoted by many 
          engineering-based firms to the war effort caused the brothers to re-assess 
          the business when the fighting stopped. Ernie bought out his brother's 
          part of the company and continued making frames until 1966 when a compulsory 
          purchase order on his premises brought the business to an end. The shop 
          was among a number of buildings cleared to make way for urban development 
          with the site now occupied by a car park. The workshop became a Marks 
          &amp; Spencer store.<br />

        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">The 
          exact date when E &amp; S Worrall began isn't known but it may have 
          been as early as 1930. The brothers were never prolific frame-builders, 
          managing, it's believed, at best a couple of hundred each year. Nevertheless, 
          there were thousands made and many of these can still be found on the 
          road in Scotland. Ernie's son, Ernie jnr, has kept examples of both. 
          Framebuilders were notoriously reticent about their output for fear 
          of giving competitors an unfair advantage. Ernie didn't reveal the dating 
          key to his frame numbering system until a few years before his death 
          !<br />
          <br />
          No catalogues were ever produced for Worrall frames but anyone wanting 
          to date their particular bike now has an easy job. Unlike some companies 
          that used complicated methods of dating their frames, the Worrall system 
          was simplicity itself - provided you knew what you were looking for. 
          The frame numbers are located on the bracket shell. The first part is 
          in the form dd/mm/yy whilst the second part refers to that particular 
          frame's place in that year's production schedule. The 233rd frame that 
          year, built on August 31, 1937, would therefore have the number 310837/233.<br />
          <br />
          Although Ernie remained an active cyclist well into his 70's, his own 
          bike had latterly been stored in a shed in the garden of his Hamilton 
          home. For years, it sat behind garden equipment and wooden sheets. Also 
          to be found in the shed, which was like a little time capsule, were 
          some of his tools and period accessories such as top tube-mounting Primus 
          stoves used in roadside "drum-ups".<br />
          <br />
          When he died on January 4, 2002, aged 93, his son presented the bike 
          to the National Museum in Edinburgh along with his dad's unique sign 
          writing equipment which had been put to such good use on the frames.</font><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br />
