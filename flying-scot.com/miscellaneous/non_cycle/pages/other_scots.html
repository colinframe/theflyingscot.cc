              neither one, nor the other. The name "Flying Scotsman" was the source 
              and was applied to the train service (as opposed to the locomotive) 
              running between London (King's Cross) and Edinburgh (Waverley) stations. 
              The service started in 1862 and was referred to as the "Special 
              Scotch Express" and by the 1870s was known as the "Flying Scotsman".

              with his glider, later to be powered, on the banks of the River

              Tyrell. Whilst Jackie retired at a time when many considered he 
              had much left to do, he never left the racing scene altogether and 
              continued as he had whilst active in racing, to campaign for safer 
              circuits and safer cars, having had one to many near miss and lost

              Paul as the fledgling Stewart racing team. His record of 27 Grand

              Flying Scot</b> : In February 2000, Boeing 737-804 (registration 
              G-BYNB) was delivered to Britannia Airways. On 17 April 2000 the 
              day of the proving flight, it was named "The Flying Scot" at Luton 
              and then flew to Glasgow Airport where it was based and operated 
              from. This was the first of two 737-800's owned by Britannia, and 
              has since joined the fleet of their Nordic subsidiary company Britannia 
              AB. It now flies under the Swedish registration SE-DZM, but still 
              with the name "The Flying Scot".</font></p></td>
