      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">The French 'Constructeur' 
        Alex Singer was known for many custom parts. Some were standard items 
        found in similar shape on many bicycles, like his fillet-brazed stems 
        and rod-actuated front derailleurs. Others were rather unique, like his 
        cam-actuated brakes. His bottom brackets were a major improvement on the 
        then-standard items, and his approach showed his independent thinking 
        - so independent in fact, that he sought and was awarded a patent for 
        his design<img src="singer_orgbrkt.gif" alt="Cut Brkt" width="300" height="135" align="right" />.<br />
        Despite the invention of caged roller bearings around the late 1890's, 
        and numerous patented ideas to utilise them to "improve" bottom brackets 
        since, they had virtually evolved to a standstill. Almost all bicycles 
        remained fitted with the traditional cup &amp; cone type running on loose 
        ball-bearings. By far the biggest improvement that was taken beyond the 
        design stage to production came about, however, when London based cycle 
        maker and engineer Maurice Selbach, replaced some traditional loose bearing 
        assemblies, with enclosed bearing sets manufactured by the British Timken 
        Co. The benefits were of reduced wear and maintenance as without the vagaries 
        of setting up and keeping 'proper' adjustment, these bearing sets produce 
        a free and easy running axle for long periods with little attention.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">Many innovative designs 
        to utilise plain and taper roller or ball bearings appeared in various 
        guises in the years before 1949. The downside of these, however, was that 
        almost all required a unique bracket shell to be made and used in combination 
        with a specially made axle. In addition they could not be fitted retrospectively 
        to the millions of bicycles already produced, and could not be adapted 
        from those bottom brackets already commercially available from the established 
        firms. Whether any of the larger cycle manufacturers ever gave much thought 
        to the idea is not known. Though there were some clever designs patented 
        or involving two of the leading bearing manufacturers, Timken and Skefco 
        (SKF), it is clear that they did not become common fitment. Whilst the 
        principles and benefits were universally accepted, few manufacturers adopted 
        them, leaving that to some of the smaller names in the business.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><img src="singer_radbrg.gif" alt="Bearing" width="69" height="89" align="left" />When 
        in 1949, Alex Singer applied for his brevet d'invention (patent), not 
        only did he propose the use of annular bearings <sup>2</sup> but he chose 
        to do this through a process of conversion. This enabled it to be used 
        on both new and old machines - in fact specific reference is made in the 
        patent application, to its ability to be used with a bracket axle having 
        worn cones. It could be applied equally to any of the bottom brackets 
        already on the market. By conversion of the standard bracket shell, and 
        purchase of an axle only, rather than a whole bracket set, it was a low 
        cost improvement utilising commercially available annular bearing sets.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">The patent application 
        translates into an almost complete guide on carrying out the conversion, 
        rather than the more usual 'framework' document.<sup>3</sup> With the 
        addition of accurate dimensions it was certainly not beyond the ability 
        of most small machine shops or even home "constructeurs" to carry out 
        this work.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">The bottom bracket 
        was first stripped down, and the original bearings and the cups discarded. 
        The bracket axle was then machined to remove the fixed cones and reduced 
        in diameter to provide a journal on both sides, for the annular bearing 
        inner race.<img src="singer_mdaxle.gif" alt="Axle" width="245" height="42" align="left" /> 
        The diameter of the middle section of the axle between the cones, also 
        appears to have been reduced, to ensure that the inner spacer sat both 
        against and partially under the bearing race. Two spacers were required, 
        the first to match the thickness and diameter of the annular bearing outer 
        race. The second and inner race spacer was, stepped down at the ends, 
        split lengthways and sized marginally bigger to ensure that when installed 
        it gripped the sides of the race. <img src="singer_osspcr.gif" alt="Spacer" width="150" height="83" align="right" /><img src="singer_inspcr.gif" alt="Sleeve" width="133" height="50" align="right" />Both 
        spacers were of a length to ensure that the annular bearing sets were 
        kept the correct distance apart, ran parallel to each other, and were 
        properly located over the journals.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">To accommodate the 
        annular bearings in a true and correctly sized housing, the bracket shell 
        was reamed out to fit the diameter of the outer race. Although this removed 
        the existing threads, the shell was partially rethreaded on both sides 
        for a short distance only, to accommodate the dust covers. These covers 
        not only provided protection for the bearings but also positive location 
        that, in combination with the two <img src="singer_dstcap.gif" alt="Dustcap" width="125" height="101" align="left" />spacers, 
        ensured, that the axle and bearings remained in proper alignment to each 
        other and to the frame.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">Reassembly was simply 
        a matter of pressing one annular bearing set onto the axle, then installing 
        the inner spacer by pressing it against and under the bearing inner race. 
        The axle was then fitted to the bracket shell, followed by the outer spacer 
        and the second annular bearing set. The bracket was completed by the fitment 
        of the two dust-caps, effectively trapping the whole assembly.<img src="singer_mdbrkt.gif" alt="Modified Brkt" width="300" height="138" align="right" /></font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">Aside from the obvious 
        functional benefits of this conversion, in perhaps typical French style, 
        there is something quite aesthetically appealing about the appearance 
        of the flush disc covers on the converted bottom bracket. Most certainly 
        better looking than the agricultural style bottom brackets that went before.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif">Almost two years 
        after application, the patent was granted on 16 May 1951, and finally 
        published on 4 September of the same year<sup>4</sup>.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000" size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><b>Notes ;</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><sup>1</sup>. Drawing 
        taken from CTC Gazette, did not credit this particular sketch to Daniel 
        Rebour however other sketches used in the article were, and this is clearly 
        his work.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><sup>2</sup>.<b> 
        </b>Annular bearing sets have a variety of names nowadays, the most common 
        being 'single row deep groove bearings', where the balls run in grooved 
        tracks between an inner and outer race assembled as a unit. This type 
        of bearing is especially suitable for both radial (i.e. down &amp; round) 
        and axial (side to side) thrust loads. When provided with a suitable means 
        of bearing retention, in this case from the dust covers, these bearing 
        units provide a positive location of the bracket axle in relation to the 
        bracket shell.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><sup>3</sup>. Most 
        patent applications give only a "framework" of the invention designed 
        to protect an idea. Generally the larger companies didn't want to give 
        too much away to their competitors and in the case of small inventors, 
        these were more often than not just "pipe dreams".</font></p>
